        "description": "• Honeywell utilizes an internal serial bus communication network to log packet data sent between connected hardware. Sqlite studio was failing business needs in linking database table data used for debugging hardware communication. Upgrading to a custom in house software solution was necessary to remove the production block that had developed.\n • Utilizing C++ and the QT framework, I was tasked with developing this application from scratch and providing the necessary groundwork for future development. The tool processes and decrypts the table data to be presented in a straightforward and understandable manner. Manual filter control and hardware packet simulation are options given to engineers as well.\n • This tool is currently being used by ~100 engineers at Honeywell to assist in their development of embedded systems."

        "description": "• GoWith is developing a mobile time-keeping app geared towards airport passengers. Using motion analysis the app calculates the time needed to go from home, through airport security to the boarding gate. • My initial role was to migrate the app from Ionic 3 to Ionic 5. This involved assessing the codebases ~20,000 lines of code for necessary changes. With 40+ app breaking updates in changing versions, moving to Ionic 5 involved immense refactoring of navigation, updating API properties, changing utilities/ dependencies and many more. • Separately from my work with version migration, I assisted developers in integrating Google Maps and Directions API. This is utilized to assist in processing motion analysis algorithms used in calculating wait times with an airport."
